# HEALTHWATCH

HealthWatch is a cloud-integrated web-based system that serves to revolutionize the care of ICU by way of point-of-care monitoring of vital signs in real-time, safe data storage, customizable alerts, and solid analytics. HealthWatch lets health professionals access up-to-date information about their patients from any location, thereby improving response times and patient outcomes. Integration of HealthWatch with ICU monitors captures all key data points from a patient, for example, heart rate, ECG, blood pressure, temperature, and securely stores it in the cloud.
HealthWatch automates the monitoring and documentation process, offering real-time tracking of patient vitals, integrated data analytics, and customizable alert systems to enhance patient safety. By digitizing these processes, HealthWatch aims to reduce the burden on healthcare staff, improve data accuracy, and ensure timely, data-driven decision-making, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective patient care in the ICU.

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The system architecture can be divided into three key sections: Data Extraction, Web Application, and Cloud Computing. Each part of the architecture uses specific technologies to ensure smooth data collection, processing, storage, and display. The HealthWatch Web Application is implemented using microservice architechture. This approach allows for independent deployment and scaling of different services, improving system performance, ease of maintenance, and future integration with additional healthcare tools.
